This paper lists (what are expected to be) non-controversial changes to the C++ standard library in response to [P0768](https://wg21.link/P0768), which adds `operator<=>` to the language. This is expected to be non-controversial because it tries to match existing behavior as much as possible.

My general algorithm to determine what operations to support are: If the type represents a value of some sort, it should at least be `weak_equality`. If the type has some sort of meaningful ordering, it should have `weak_ordering`. We should be cautious in giving polymorphic types `operator<=>` (but if they already have other comparison operators, then we might as well).

This document should contain a complete list of types or categories of types in C++.

## Revision History

R1: A much broader version of this paper was presented to LEWG at a previous meeting. What remains in this paper is everything which the group did not find controversial and which does not require significant justification. All controversial aspects will be submitted in separate papers.

## Backward Compatibility

The `operator<=>` proposal was written such that the "generated" operators are equivalent to source code rewrites â€“ there is no actual `operator==` that a user could take the address of. Users are not allowed to form pointers to standard library member functions and are unable to form pointers to friend functions defined inline in the class. There are some cases where we do not specify how the operator was implemented, only that the expression `a @ b` is valid; these cases are not broken by such a change because users could not have depended on it, anyway. In general, we accept changes that overload existing functions, which also has the effect of breaking code which takes the address of a free function.

* `ratio`
* `integer_sequence`
* `seed_seq` (paper needed to add `strong_equality`)
* `enable_shared_from_this`: It would be nice to give it a `strong_ordering` to allow derived classes to `= default`. However, this means that all classes that do not explicitly delete their comparison operator get an `operator<=>` that compares only the `enable_shared_from_this` base class, which is almost certainly wrong. Since this is intended to be used as a base class, we should not add `operator<=>` to it. Moreover, classes which `enable_shared_from_this` are unlikely to be basic value classes so they do not lose much by not being able to default.
* `initializer_list`: `initializer_list` is a reference type. It would be strange to give it reference semantics on copy but value semantics for comparison. It would also be surprising if two `initializer_list` containing the same set of values compared as not equal. Therefore, I recommend not defining it for this type.

## Types that will get their `operator<=>` from a conversion operator

These types will get `operator<=>` if possible without any changes, just like they already have whatever comparison operators their underlying type has.

* `integral_constant` and all types deriving from `integral_constant` (has `operator T`)
* `bitset::reference` (has `operator bool`)
* `reference_wrapper` (has `operator T &`)
* `atomic` (has `operator T`)

This has the disadvantage that types which have a template comparison operator will not have their wrapper convertible. For instance, `std::reference_wrapper<std::string>` is not currently comparable. This does not affect `bitset::reference`, as it has a fixed conversion to `bool`, but it does affect the other three.

## Types that wrap another type

* `array`
* `deque`
* `forward_list`
* `list`
* `vector` (including `vector<bool>`)
* `map`
* `set`
* `multimap`
* `multiset`
* `unordered_map`
* `unodered_set`
* `unodered_multimap`
* `unordered_multiset`
* `queue`
* `queue::iterator`
* `priority_queue`
* `priority_queue::iterator`
* `stack`
* `stack::iterator`
* `pair`
* `tuple`
* `reverse_iterator`
* `move_iterator`
* `optional`
* `variant`

This turned out to be much more complicated than expected and will require its own paper.

### `basic_string`, `basic_string_view`, `char_traits`, and `sub_match`

Properly integrating `operator<=>` with these types requires more thought than this paper has room for, and thus will be discussed separately.

### `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr`

They contain state that is not observed in the comparison operators. Therefore, they will get their own paper.

### valarray

Current comparison operators return a `valarray<bool>`, giving you the result for each pair (with undefined behavior for differently-sized `valarray` arguments). It might make sense to provide some sort of function that returns `valarray<comparison_category>`, but that should not be named `operator<=>`. This paper does not suggest adding `operator<=>` to `valarray`.

## Types that have no comparisons now but are being proposed to get `operator<=>` in another paper

This paper does not propose changing any of the following types -- they are here only for completeness.

* `filesystem::file_status`
* `filesystem::space_info`
* `slice`
* `gslice`
* `to_chars_result`
* `from_chars_result`
* `div_t`
* `ldiv_t`
* `lldiv_t`
* `imaxdiv_t`
* `timespec`
* `tm`
* `lconv`
* `fenv_t`
* `fpos_t`
* `mbstate_t`

## `nullptr_t`

Already supports `strong_equality` in the working draft. I will be writing a separate paper proposing `strong_ordering`.

## Not Updating Concepts That Provide Comparisons

This category includes things like `BinaryPredicate` and `Compare`. There will be a separate paper proposing what to do about those concepts.

## Not Updating Concepts That Require Comparisons

When we specify generic type concepts, should we specify in terms of `operator<=>`? If we do so, it means that functions that accept a user-defined type corresponding to some concept no longer match that concept, unless the user-defined type adds `operator<=>`. As an example, the `RandomAccessIterator` concept requires all six operators to be present. At some point in the future, do we want to change this requirement to `weak_ordering operator<=>`? Same with weaker iterator concepts, do we want `weak_equality` or stronger? The following are the minimal mappings that I believe each concept requires:

* `EqualityComparable`: `weak_equality`
* `LessThanComparable`: `weak_ordering` (this would exclude floating point values, as `LessThanComparable` requires a strict weak ordering)
* `NullablePointer`: inherits `EqualityComparable`, additionally requires `!=` (works automatically if we change `EqualityComparable` to require `weak_equality`). Requires heterogeneous `weak_equality` with `nullptr_t`.
* `InputIterator`: inherits `EqualityComparable`, additionally requires `!=` (works automatically if we change `EqualityComparable` to require `weak_equality`).
* `Allocator`: `weak_equality`, heterogeneous with the equivalent `Allocator` for other types
* `"bitmask type"`: `strong_equality` (it might be a `bitset`, which supports only equality, it might be integer or enum, which supports ordering, but this will naturally fall out, no wording changes are needed here)
* We redundantly specify `weak_ordering` for `TrivialClock::rep`, `TrivialClock::duration`, and `TrivialClock::time_point`, but that is implied because we know they are an arithmetic type, a `chrono::duration`, and a `chrono::time_point`, respectively.

Note that by applying `operator<=>`, we frequently end up with more operators than just those minimally required by the existing concept.

This paper does not recommend changing the definitions of these concepts to require `operator<=>`. `operator<=>` is a valid implementation strategy to satisfy these concepts, but should not be required, as all that we care about for these concepts is the direct comparisons. This ensures backward compatibility with old user-defined types.

## Deprecation

We should deprecate the following functions in favor of `operator<=>`.

* `istreambuf_iterator::equal`.
* `filesystem::path::compare`.

`std::filesystem::equivalent` currently exists and provides a weak equality ("Do these two paths resolve to the same file?"). Should this be deprecated in favor of the new generic free function `std::weak_equal`?

## Miscellaneous

All `operator<=>` should be `constexpr` and `noexcept` where possible, following the lead of the language feature and allowing `= default` as an implementation strategy for some types.

When we list a result type as "unspecified" it is unspecified whether it has `operator<=>`. There are not any unspecified result types for which we currently guarantee any comparison operators are present, so there is no extra work to do here.
